Here's a topic I've been wanting to bridge for a long time - getting
player feedback in D&D and RPGs. Paying more attention to my players
and treating our sessions like a working-relationship has brought my
game to a different level. Not everyone will care for this, but since
you're reading this, I'm guessing you might.

To get quality feedback on your role-playing games, you need to
establish psychological safety at your gaming table. Before asking for
feedback, set a precedent of being vulnerable and open to it. Once
you've established the right environment for feedback, your players
will share the same comfort and vulnerability, and they'll provide
more meaningful feedback than "yes", "no", or "it was fun."

There's a lot to unpack, here. Each of the coming sections are
valuable on their own, but if you can implement them as a whole, you
will see greater results more often. Read on if you want to unlock the
secrets to getting player feedback.

# Build psychological safety at your table
You might not have heard of psychological safety, but I think you will
understand what it means when we discuss it.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety):

> "Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's self
> without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or
> career"

You should build psychological safety at your gaming table because, by
definition, it is **required** for your players to provide
constructive feedback. Without psychological safety, your players will
not be comfortable sharing things out of fear that they're not welcome
or that their feedback is not welcome.

Being micro-managed at work is an example of an environment with poor
psychological safety. Whatever you say gets questioned by your boss,
even though you're a qualified employee. In this environment, you are
not inclined to provide feedback, because it always gets shot-down.
You might feel like your contribution at work is useless and that
you're a dispensable employee.

Being among your closest friends might be an example of an environment
with good psychological safety. You're comfortable and confident of
your place in the group. In this environment, you aren't afraid to
speak-up. With especially strong psychological safety, you might even
call-out or confront your friends if they aren't being themselves or
aren't acting with integrity.

Your table will have a varying degree of psychological safety. If it's
on the low-end of the scale, shy players won't be comfortable
expressing themselves and "loud" players will provide non-constructive
feedback when they do. If the table has a higher level of
psychological safety, even shy players will speak up and "loud"
players will be more cooperative.

Psychological safety is a popular topic of research in leadership and
management, nowadays. It is one of the most studied conditions for
enabling positive group dynamics. You can't have a high-performing
team without psychological safety - at least, not a happy one.

I've dealt with micro-management and poor psychological safety at my
day-job, so identifying this came naturally to me.

So, with all this exploration on the topic of psychological safety:
how do we promote it? Easy. Lead by example. Set a precedent of
vulnerability by being humble. Openly admit to your mistakes.

# Set a precedent of openness and vulnerability
You want to have a group of players that are *comfortable* sharing
their concerns and that are *comfortable* providing feedback, even if
they think the feedback will upset you. You need to set a precedent
that will enable that.

To establish psychological safety with your group, you need to set a
precedent that promotes vulnerability and acceptance. Lead by example.
Every time you get together, try to ask questions that put you in a
vulnerable position. Admit to mistakes that you've made. Apologize
honestly for recent mistakes, and discuss how you plan on addressing
them to prevent future occurrences. Discuss how you've taken specific
pieces of feedback into consideration, and reveal your
thought-process.

This won't be easy. Doing this is the equivalent of initiating a
serious conversation with someone. Let me show you how I do this with
some examples.

## Admitting to your mistakes
In this example, I ran a session where the combat took too long. The
combat started getting boring for me and the players, and I noticed it
during the session. I brought it up after the session, and admitted
that it was a mistake.

> "That was a good session, guys. I'd like to ask for feedback, but
> more specifically, I'm concerned about how I ran the combat, today.
> I feel like things really dragged on, and got pretty boring. I've
> got some ideas on how to improve it for next session, but I'm just
> wondering what you guys thought about it. I think that any combat
> going for longer than 20-30 minutes seems to drag on."

Notice how I asked for feedback, but don't really need it or care for
it. I already know that the combat could have been better, and I
already have some ideas on how to improve it.

This technique is great to start building psychological safety and to
maintain it. Admitting to mistakes that you've made shows your group
that you're prone to error like them, and that you're willing to work
on it. If you put your mistake up for discussion, that's even better.
If you can get the players to share their view on *your* mistake, it
communicates that this kind of discussion is accepted at the table. It
shows them that if they invest themselves and participate at the
table, they won't be laughed at, and the discussions can be
reasonable.

Be honest and truthful! Embody the type of person you want your
players to be. Show them that there's no shame in making mistakes!

## Show that you're taking initiative
Show to your players that you're *actually* following-up on feedback.

In this example, I open a session by discussing feedback from the
previous session. I repeat the feedback in my own words, and confirm
my understanding of it with the players. I then step the group through
the thought-process I took, and explain what I'm doing about it.

> "Hey, guys. Thanks for all making it to today's game. I just want to
> touch on some of the feedback you guys gave me last time. Nick: you
> brought up how you didn't like how the game slowed to a halt last
> time when you guys had all these doors to presented to you. Am I
> correct in saying that that's related to not really enjoying a slow,
> boring, dungeon crawl?"

> "Yeah."

> "Well, I gave it some thought, and I didn't really like it, either.
> That's actually like a "Chekhov's gun", but I'm doing it all wrong!
> I'm presenting you guys with all these doors and set pieces, but so
> many of them are pointless! I mean, I can't believe I presented a
> door to you guys that you argued about entering for like 10
> minutes - and in the end it was a closet! Yeah, I can see why that's
> annoying! I've got some ideas on how I'm going to change that in the
> coming sessions. I don't have it yet, so I'll do the best I can to
> make today's game better, but the main changes are yet to come."

I started by discussing feedback from the previous session. When you
do this, you show your players that you follow-through on your
commitments. It assures your players that whatever they bring-up will
be dealt with. Or at the very least, considered. You want your players
to *know* that you always give careful consideration to their
feedback.

You should make sure your understanding of a piece of feedback matches
the players' understanding of it. Repeat the feedback in your own
words, and ask if you understood it correctly. Doing this shows your
players that you're making an effort to resolve the same thing they've
brought-up, rather than resolving something different. If you don't
make a habit of getting on the same page with your players, you risk
damaging trust at the table. Players need to *know* that you are
competent at addressing issues.

Once you've got everyone's attention on the same topic, you can tell
them what you're doing about it. It can help to step through the
thought-process you followed to reach your decision. This shows your
group that you're honest (or trying to be) by being transparent.
Follow this up by showing them what steps you've already taken towards
solving the problem. Your players will trust you more when you present
yourself as a confident, competent, and proactive Game Master.

Act. Have some accountability to your players. Show that you're taking
the lead.

## Open yourself to receiving feedback anytime
Remind your players that you can take feedback over text, and openly
invite it. Players will appreciate knowing that you're willing to
listen to their concerns and work with them at any time.

In this example, I solicit feedback at the end of a session, but I
invite the players to do it over text, rather than in-person.

> "That was a good session, guys. This may be weird for me to say, but
> I just want to say that I'm always trying improve my game. I'd like
> to ask for feedback on this game, but since this is the first time I
> bring this up, I don't actually want to take any right now, at the
> table. However, I am asking that if you guys have any feedback, you
> can text me later, or any other time. I *love* talking about running
> RPGs and how to make them better, and I want to make sure you guys
> are having as much fun as I am.

This technique is great for when you don't have a precedent of asking
for feedback after sessions. Try this out when you're not sure where
your table's psychological safety is at, and you want to kick-start
the process of building it.

The introductory statement ("This may be weird for me to say,
but[...]") can be absolutely **polarizing**. If you can preface a
conversation with this and genuinely mean it, the rest of the
conversation will have a serious tone to it. It immediately puts you
in a vulnerable position that will stun your players. They will be
listening attentively.

If a session runs long, and I don't have time to discuss any feedback
in depth, this is the technique I use - I remind everyone that I'm
always open to feedback over text. I do this to maintain the
psychological safety that I've worked hard to establish while still
closing the session at a reasonable time.

Be a true friend of your players. Be there to listen to them and
support them.

# Effective ways of asking for feedback
When your group is comfortable sharing at the table, you can start
asking for feedback. I've shown a few techniques in the above
examples, but let me point them out more clearly.

When you ask for feedback, ask open questions (non-polar questions),
which incite elaboration. If you ask polar-questions ("yes/no"
questions), you'll receive "yes/no" responses. Asking questions that
start with *'how'*, *'what'*, *'when'*, or *'where'*, are a good way
to receive meaningful answers and don't make as many assumptions.

One technique is to ask for feedback about something *specific*.
Instead of asking for feedback in general, ask for feedback on a
specific thing that happened at the table. Even asking *"What did you
guys think of the combat?"* could be too broad. Be specific: *"What did you
guys think of the combat with the boss?"*

From one of the earlier examples, if you admit to something you did
wrong at the same time that you request feedback, you can get
*critical feedback* rather than just compliments. *"What did you guys
think of the combat? I'm asking because I don't feel like I ran it
that great. Everything felt flat and uninteresting."*

My favorite technique is to ask for feedback, but only taking it over
text. I get my most meaningful feedback when I ask players for
feedback privately.

Remember that asking for feedback publicly gets a public
response, while asking for feedback privately gets a private response.
If you ask for feedback in front of the whole group, they'll feel
inclined to answer in front of the whole group. If you ask for
feedback over direct messages to individual players, they'll feel
inclined to answer privately.

I'm interested in hearing what other people have to say about this.
Psychological safety, and managing conflict and expectations holds a
special place at my table. I want to hear from people like you,
because I've never seen this discussed elsewhere...at all!
