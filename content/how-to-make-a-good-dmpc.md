There's a lot of attention and negative connotation around DMPCs. So
much so that you've found your way to this blog post! I trust that if
you're reading this, you've been asking yourself a few questions on
DMPCs and how to run them properly. I'll share some experience, and
hopefully we can all benefit from it.

To make a good DMPC, aim to make a good NPC instead. Your DMPC should
be liked by the party, defer decisions to the party, and should avoid
overshadowing the party with unfair advantages from the DM. Use you
DMPC as a storytelling tool, and as a way to fill a specific skill gap
in the party. Like any good, interesting NPC, your DMPC should have
their own agenda.

Do read on. I want to ensure that you see success with your DMPC.

# Make your DMPC likeable
Like any NPC that you want your players to interact with, let's make
your DMPC likeable.

- Make your DMPC a normal person. Although your players will often
  latch onto eccentric, quirky, and strange NPCs, try making your DMPC
  a regular person with a regular occupation.
- Give your DMPC a stereotype. Using stereotypes makes things
  instantly recognizable to your players. For example: a friendly
  stout dwarf looks like a potential loyal teammate, while a secretive
  hooded rogue looks like a potential betrayal.
- Make your DMPC a genuine, good person. Or make your DMPC whatever
  they need to be for your party to like them. If your party distrusts
  secretive NPCs, then don't make your DMPC secretive. Also, avoid
  making your DMPC *overly* good and honest. For some reason, most of
  my groups distrust NPCs that have nothing to hide.
- Give your DMPC goals, ambitions, and an agenda. You might be
  fortunate to have a group of players that will readily invite your
  DMPC into the party. If not, your DMPC will need a reason for
  offering to join. Having an agenda and a personality is what makes
  your DMPC more than just words and numbers scribbled in your session
  notes.

You should tailor these to your group's interests and tendencies to
maximise your chance of success.

# Give your DMPC their own voice
Like all other NPCs in your game world, DMPCs need their own point of
view. Give your DMPC an agenda. When they act, make sure you role-play
their agenda and personality confidently.

If your DMPC doesn't act in their own agenda's interest, the DMPC
won't be believable. The players' immersion will start breaking down
as they suspect the DM is trying to steer the players with the help of
the DMPC.

Imagine this: your party has been drinking at the tavern all night,
and they're ready to brawl with rivals. The mead-loving DMPC dwarf
says "maybe we should leave them alone for tonight" instead of saying
what a mead-loving dwarf *would* say - "hold this while I knock their
lights out!" In the former situation, it feels like the DM is trying
to hold you back while in the latter, it feels like the DM is cheering
you on!

# Use your DMPC as a tool
Once your players accept the DMPC into the party, the DMPC becomes an
instrumental tool to the DM.

A DMPC that's been accepted into the party can:
- Fill a specific gap in the party's skillset
- Act in favor of moving the story or the game forward

If the party is missing a specific skillset, your DMPC can be designed
to fill it. If you have a small group of players, their choice of
characters won't likely be ideal. They might be missing a thief, a
melee fighter, or a healer, and the DMPC can be brought in after
you've identified the gap that needs filling.

You can take that one step further, and actually make a character
sheet for the DMPC. That way, the party can control them. Small groups
might be needing an extra body or two in combat for balancing the
combat mechanics.

In our example above with the mead-loving DMPC dwarf, some of you may
have thought that having the DMPC try calling the group in for the
night would be fine - the DM might not want to run a barroom brawl.
However, if the players *wanted* to have a barroom brawl and worked
towards having one, they would feel like their expectations have just
been violated and that you've just taken that option away from them
selfishly.

# The pitfalls of playing a DMPC
Your DMPC can significantly influence the party, but each time they
make a suggestion, you put your reputation on the line. There are
pitfalls to running a DMPC, and making mistakes can often harm your
integrity as a DM. Here are the things you should **not** do when
running a DMPC:
- Play in your own game
- Make decisions for the party
- Force the DMPC to stay in the party

**Don't** run a DMPC because you want "a chance to play." There are so
many issues with creating a DMPC with this mentality, but at the heart
of it, it's selfish. It doesn't serve the players or the table. It
serves you alone. Selfish behavior doesn't contribute to a better
game, so keep it away from your table. "Forever DMs" sometimes run a
DMPC for this reason, but there are better ways to solve the "forever
DM" problem. Playing in your own game is a poor shortcut to take, and
may even further entrench you into that role. I'll have to write on
some ways to break out of the Forever DM role in a future article.

Give your DMPC a voice and an agenda. This is not just re-iterating
from one of the previous sections, because this time I'm telling you
that your DMPC *needs* a voice and agenda. If you fail to give them
this bit of personality, any action they take could look like you're
intruding in the game. Selfish behavior is a red-flag and root-cause
of many bad DMs. You may not ruin your game today, but left unchecked,
it can grow resentment among your players.

The DMPC should defer decisions to the party. They absolutely *can*
make their own suggestions (as long as it's done with their agenda in
mind), but they should let the party have the final say. If your DMPC
is the type to kick down the front door and fight, it might be funny
to have them do that, but no more than once, or they're taking away
agency from your players. Pulling a Leeroy Jenkins is a great way for
anyone to show they personality of the character they're playing, but
doing it at *every* opportunity "because that's what my character
would do" is annoying for everyone.

And **don't** force your DMPC to stay in the party. Unless your DMPC
has compelling reasons to stay in the party, or is required for the
story, this is touching again on the selfish behavior.

These are some pretty heavy consequences! Give your DMPC an exit plan.
Check out [Sly
Flourish's](https://slyflourish.com/tag-along_npcs.html) article on
NPCs. Give your DMPC a reason to leave the party in case you feel the
DMPC is unsuccessful. Some ideas: an insatiable wanderlust, a
deathwish, a previous commitment, fear of danger, fear of the party.

# Assess why you need a DMPC
The truth is - you're actually just creating an NPC. The term "DMPC"
describes a degenerate case where the DM is trying to live the player
experience of the game through an NPC.

Here are the guidelines to running an NPC without letting them
sabotage the game:
- Don't force the NPC to join the party
- Don't force the party to keep the NPC
- Don't let the NPC make all the decisions for the party
- Don't use the NPC to "play in your own game"
- Don't force anything onto your players

With these guidelines in mind, I invite you to stop using the term
"DMPC". We should instead be discussing the root cause of this problem
and addressing it by what it is: selfish behavior.

I don't think you need a DMPC. I think you need something else. Maybe
you need to make more NPCs for your game, or maybe you need to make
them more interesting. Maybe the things you're doing in your game
aren't sustaining your enjoyment. Either way, if you thought you
needed a DMPC, you might consider reflecting some more on your game.

Now go have fun with your NPCs! Bring all sorts of interesting
characters to the game!
