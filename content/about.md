Hey, guys - I'm Justin St-Amant.

This is my tabletop engineering journal.

I put together this site to compile my experience as a Game Master, or
better yet...as a curator of experiences! My goal is to document the
hours that I rant on game mastery I do in-between RPG sessions that I
either participate as a player or participate as the Game Master.

I take role-playing games very seriously. Yes, even though it's just a
hobby, I find many pertinent connections between this hobby and the
skills that I'm trying to improve in my day-to-day life.

Much like engineering, the quality of my games depend on my education
and experience. Every decision I make as a Game Master is carefully
calculated and subconsciously takes many engineering considerations.

I'll note that I primarily play in my friends' Dungeons & Dragons
games, at the moment. I don't usually run Dungeons & Dragons. I mostly
run Index Card RPG, Delta Green, FUDGE, and Traveller, but at the same
time, I think you could call my games "homebrew"...

...My games are straight-up designed to deliver the experience I
intend on delivering...

...My games are straight-up designed to convey the atmosphere I intend
on conveying...

...My games are straight-up engineered!

I don't use any rules in my games that I haven't explicitly given
engineering consideration to. Approach your games with intention!
