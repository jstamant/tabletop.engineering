Hey, guys - I'm Justin St-Amant.

This is my tabletop engineering journal.

I put together this site to compile my experience as a Game Master (GM), or
better yet, as a curator of experiences. My goal is to document the hours of
game mastery ranting I do in-between RPG sessions that I either participate as a
player or participate as the Game Master.

I take role-playing games very seriously. Yes, even though it's just a hobby, I
find many pertinent connections between the hobby and life skills.

Much like engineering, the quality of my games depend on my education and
experience. Every decision I make as a GM is carefully calculated and takes
many engineering considerations.

I'll note that I primarily play in my friends' Dungeons & Dragons games,
however, I never run games of Dungeons & Dragons myself. I guess you could
say that my games are "homebrew", but not really - They're straight-up designed
to deliver the experience I intend on delivering - They're straight-up designed
to convey the atmosphere I intend on conveying - They're straight-up
engineered.

I don't use any rules in my games that I haven't explicitly given engineering
consideration to, and neither should you. Approach your games with intention.
Role-playing games are a craft, but you can make them a life-style, and you can
engineer your life-style.
