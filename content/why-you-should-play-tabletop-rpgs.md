If you stumbled across this page from Google, then I'm very happy you
clicked on this first post! I love RPGs, I've played them for years,
and I'd like to show you some of the reasons why you (and everyone)
should play them!

You should play tabletop RPGs because not only is it fun, but it
builds many soft and hard skills. Regardless of whether you're a
player or whether you're the host/GM, you'll be using skills that you
don't use day-to-day. And on top of that, the market for tabletop RPGs
is so vast now, that you're guaranteed to find something you like.

I've got some more to say about this, like all other RPG conversation
topics, so I urge you to read-on!

# You're guaranteed to like *something* about RPGs

There are so many different facets in RPGs that you'll come across
some that you like more than others. For example, many players that
play Dungeons & Dragons like it for its tactical combat and strongly
defined rules. Other players prefer role-playing scenes between the
characters. Here's a list of things you'll likely come across and
might come to enjoy while playing RPGs:

- Tactical "rigid" combat
- Cinematic "loose" combat
- Role-playing
- Hanging out with friends
- Sharing stories and experiences with friends
- Meeting new people
- Making friends laugh

There's plenty to enjoy outside the game itself. A lot of people
aren't comfortable with the thought of role-playing, but can
appreciate the game for its other facets, like spending time with
friends.

# You're guaranteed to like a specific game-system

Apart from finding something appealing about playing RPGs, I think
you're also guaranteed to find a *game-system* that appeals to you.

The market is so large and saturated with good game-systems that
you're bound to find one that you like. For most beginner players that
get into D&D, they end-up loving it and learning the intricacies of
the rules. Without getting into any of the "indie" games of RPGs, you
can easily find a well-known game-system that you like.

For me personally, my go-to game is [Index Card
RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/212262/INDEX-CARD-RPG-Core-2E) -
A bare-bones version of D&D that does what my players love best -
kicking ass. I'll have to visit the strengths of other game-systems in
a future post.

# Develops storytelling, performance, and social skills

One of my favorite parts of playing RPGs are the skills that I develop
as a result. Here's a list of skills that you can develop if you
participate in role-playing games:

- Acting/role-playing. Learn how to emulate a character's person.
- Improvising. Learn how to come up with realistic details on the
  spot.
- Creativity. Learn how to apply your creative muscle in the game. You
  can apply all forms of art to pique your group's interest. Try using
  haikus, musical intruments, or drawing to add flavor to your
  character.
- Performing. Learn how to put on a show in front of your group.
- Storytelling. Learn how to use cadence and rythm when describing
  things and when telling a story.
- Leadership. Learn to lead by example and to move things along.
- Management. When conflict arises at the table, you can learn how to
  resolve it in the moment, as well as in between sessions. Sometimes,
  a certain player's behavior is unreasonable, like throwing tantrums
  when things don't go their way in the game. Some groups just
  tolerate poor behaviors, but you can be an adult and have that
  difficult conversation with the player.
- Social etiquette. Learn how to respect your friend's house and
  property. You do things like putting your drink on a coaster, wiping
  your cheeto-fingers on napkins instead of your shirt, and bringing
  snacks or drinks as a guest.
- Hosting/entertaining. When you run games, or if you have them at
  your place, you learn how to clean-up and have the place ready to
  entertain your guests.
- Reading body language. You learn how to gauge your players'
  attention and interest in order to make positive changes that
  contribute to everyone's fun.
- Writing. If you run a game, the planning and world-building that you
  do are practices in *writing*.

When I host games, I actively work at improving my skills. When I play
in games, I tend to develop these skills passively. However, like most
hobbies and activities, you'll get as much out of it as you put in.

# There are very few reasons why you *shouldn't* play RPGs

I'd like to go as far as saying that there are NO good reasons why you
shouldn't try RPGs.

I've heard it said many times that "It's cool now." and I think so
too. With [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/) being so popular at
about 1.5M subscribers on YouTube, it's a challenge to find someone
that hasn't heard of D&D or played it. Many people are interested in
playing it, but don't have a group to play in.

I've even met closeted D&D players - people that deny playing D&D, but
actually love it. If the only thing that's keeping you from playing an
RPG is fear, cast your doubt aside! Stop caring about what other
people think! The only thing that could make RPGs lame or nerdy are
your insecurities. Own it. If this is what you want to try, then do it
confidently! Only inaction is the biggest mistake you could make.

You can't go wrong with playing RPGs. If you have the opportunity to
try it for the first time - do it head-first; all-in. The worst that
could happen is that the game turns out to be boring or lame. No
worries. You can leave the group and save yourself from participating
in any of those future lame sessions.

Not all GMs run their games the same. I'm confident that if your first
experience playing an RPG was boring, lame, or negative, you haven't
found a good Game Master or group of players. Don't immediately
dismiss RPGs as terrible. There's always the possibility you'll have
an amazing experience trying again with a different group.
