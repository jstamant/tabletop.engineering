# [Tabletop Engineering](https://tabletop.engineering/)

This is the repository where I keep all the content and site configuration for [Tabletop Engineering](https://tabletop.engineering/).

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

(Jan 25, 2024) I recently moved the site from *Hugo* to *Next.js*. I made this change due to Next's speed, flexibility, and support for CSS and JS tools. With React Server Components, Next is a real contender to static site generators like Hugo. I also prefer programming with React than I do with Hugo's Go templates.
