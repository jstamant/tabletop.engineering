# Tabletop Engineering

This is the repository where I keep all the content and site configuration for
[Tabletop Engineering](https://tabletop.engineering).

I build Tabletop Engineering's website using Hugo. Because of this, all of the
website's files are static, and load very quickly. For more information about
the design and programming of the website, see my other repository,
[`jstamant/hugo-theme`](https://github.com/jstamant/hugo-theme).

I'll note that `jstamant/hugo-theme` is a submodule of this repository. I build
the website from here, and push to generated files to my server.
