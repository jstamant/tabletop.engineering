Hey, guys. I'm Justin St-Amant. This is my tabletop engineering journal.

I put together this site to compile my experience as a Game Master, or as I like
to see it: a curator of experiences! My goal with this blog is to capture my
deep-dive ideas and thoughts on tabletop role-playing games, and to organize
them neatly for everyone's use.

I take role-playing games very seriously. Even though it's just a hobby, I find
that its practice spans many soft-skills, such as leadership, management,
entertaining, and hosting, just to name a few.

Much like engineering, the quality of my games depends on my education and
experience. Every decision I make as a Game Master is carefully calculated;
every calculation subconsciously takes dozens, or even hundreds, of engineering
considerations.

When I prepare games for my friends, I have a single principle that I like to
adhere to:

> be intentional

I approach my games with intention and careful consideration. With that said, I
don't use any rules in my games that I haven't explicitly given some sort of
consideration to.

Going into a game, I must deliver the experience I intended on delivering. I
must convey the atmosphere I intended on conveying.

I engineer my games to mitigate the risk of failure. [Do you?](how-to-get-player-feedback-in-dnd.md)
