Hey, guys. I'm Justin St-Amant. I'm the one running the show at Tabletop
Engineering.

If you have any comments or feedback, feel free to send me an email at
justin@tabletop.engineering. As of updating this page, I'm not receiving many
emails, so there's a good chance that I reply.

Since I like programming and I developed this website by myself, I better link
to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jstamant).

This is a static website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The repository
for this website and its theme are located at
[jstamant/tabletop.engineering](https://github.com/jstamant/tabletop.engineering)
and [jstamant/hugo-theme](https://github.com/jstamant/hugo-theme).
