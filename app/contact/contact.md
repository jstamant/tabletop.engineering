Hey, guys. I'm Justin St-Amant. I'm the one running the show at Tabletop
Engineering.

If you have any comments or feedback, feel free to send me an email at
[justin@tabletopengineering.com](mailto:justin@tabletopengineering.com). As
of updating this page, I'm not receiving many emails, so there's a
good chance that I reply.

Since I like programming and I developed this website by myself, I better link
to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jstamant).

This is a static website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
The repository for this website is located at
[jstamant/tabletop.engineering](https://github.com/jstamant/tabletop.engineering/).
