When dealing with indecision or anxiety around something, ask yourself
these questions:
- What's the *worst* that can happen?
- How likely is that going to happen?
- What's the *best* thing that can happen, and how likely?

Asking yourself these questions will likely give you some positive
perspective. When running a game for your first time, what's the worst
that could happen? The game is so bad that your friends abandon you
and never join you again? That seems pretty unlikely, if not
impossible. What about the best thing that can happen from running a
game for your first time? Raging success? Your friends love the game
so much that they give you a round of applause? That sounds more
likely to me. You're much more likely to run an okay game than to run
a terrible game. I'm not asking you - I'm telling you.

ABOUT HOW TO BRING-UP FEEDBACK
When you bring-up feedback, make sure to give your players plenty of
context so they can follow the conversation. Open the conversation as
if you were answering a long answer question. **Don't** open without
**fully** wording the piece of feedback you're talking about. Don't
say:

> "So about that feedback from last week.."

At best, only half your group will remember the feedback from the week
before. Instead, say:

> "So I'd like to talk about Nick's feedback from last week. We were
> talking about how the game seemed to slow down too much when you
> were exploring the dungeon..."

Opening a conversation like this will ensure that all players are on
the same page with what's being discussed.

# on being a good DM
Your DM should value your feedback, especially if it's constructive.
It's a red-flag if your DM does nothing but come up with excuses and
invalidate your concerns.

## When you really don't like the game
If for some reason, you're really not liking the game you're in,
there's feedback there that can be communicated to your DM.

Before you go ahead and disappear from the game, consider what an
adult would do. If your DM has been at least running a mediocre game,
then you owe it to them by at least giving some feedback or telling
them that you'll no longer be attending sessions. Unless your DM is
riddled with red flags, you should make an effort to bring up what's
bothering you.

Try discussing your concerns with the game early, before you let them
fester to resentment. Once you bring up feedback, you should stick
around for a few sessions to see if/how the DM incorporates it into
their game. If you're ready to quit the game, and you're convinced
that there's no way of fixing it, sticking around to see if the game
improves won't be pleasant for you.

You'll also see that if you're on the brink of quitting the game,
talking to the DM will likely defuse your negative experience for the
time being.

The first step of addressing conflict in the workplace is to confront
the person directly before escalating the conflict to the next level.
If you don't do this, you can't really tell yourself and tell others
that you tried fixing it.

However, I don't want to detract from quitting a game if the DM and/or
the table is showing some serious red flags. That's a topic for
another time, but there's definitely behavior out there that warrants
running away!
